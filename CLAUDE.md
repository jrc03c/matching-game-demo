# Memory Card Game

A browser-based card-matching memory game built with vanilla web technologies.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks, no build tools)
- Opens directly via `index.html` in a browser (no server required)

## File Structure

- `index.html` — Page structure: score panel, card grid (generated by JS), win modal
- `style.css` — Theming via CSS custom properties, 3D card flip transitions, responsive grid
- `script.js` — Game state, shuffle, card click handling, timer, win detection
- `test-game.mjs` — Playwright end-to-end tests (20 assertions covering all core mechanics)

## Game Mechanics

- 4x4 grid of 8 emoji pairs: 🐶 🐱 🐸 🦊 🐼 🦁 🐧 🦋
- A "move" = one pair attempt (two flips), not each individual flip
- Timer starts on the first card click, not on page load
- Input is locked during the 1-second mismatch delay
- Star rating: 3 stars (< 10 moves), 2 stars (< 16 moves), 1 star (16+)
- Win modal shows final moves, time, and star rating

## Design

- Muted palette with CSS custom properties in `:root` for easy theming
- 3D card flip via `perspective` / `transform-style: preserve-3d` / `backface-visibility`
- Dark card backs with `?` and radial gradient; teal accent border + glow on matches
- Responsive breakpoint at 480px

## Code Conventions

- ES6+ throughout (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Game logic separated from DOM manipulation
- Single delegated click listener on the grid (`e.target.closest('.card')`)

## Testing

Run the Playwright test suite (headful — opens a visible browser):

```
node test-game.mjs
```

To run headless, change `chromium.launch({ headless: false })` to `chromium.launch()` in `test-game.mjs`.

Requires: `npm install` (installs Playwright), then `npx playwright install chromium` if browsers aren't cached.

## Workflow Preferences

- Plan before coding — outline architecture and get approval before implementing
- Parallelize independent work (e.g., HTML/CSS/JS can be written concurrently)
- After changes, run `node test-game.mjs` to verify nothing is broken
